Spam Detector for Email and SMS using Flask and ML
The Spam Detector for Email and SMS is a software tool that can identify and filter out spam messages from emails and SMS. This tool is built using Flask, a Python-based web framework, and machine learning algorithms to analyze messages and determine whether they are spam or not.


## Features

**Email and SMS Filtering**: The software automatically filters incoming messages for email and SMS, flagging them as spam or not spam.

**Machine Learning Algorithms**: The tool uses machine learning algorithms to analyze messages and determine whether they are spam or not. These algorithms are constantly updated to improve the accuracy of the software. 

**Customizable Rules**: Users can customize the rules for filtering messages based on their individual needs and preferences.


**Web-based User Interface**: The tool has a web-based user interface that allows users to interact with the system

## Working
The Spam Detector for Email and SMS works by analyzing the content of the incoming messages to determine whether they are spam or not. It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze messages based on several factors such as the sender of the message, the content of the message, and user behavior.

The tool assigns a score to each message, indicating the likelihood that it is spam. Messages that receive a high score are flagged as spam and filtered out, while messages that receive a low score are allowed through.

The user can customize the rules for filtering messages, based on their individual needs and preferences. The tool can be trained on a dataset of spam and non-spam messages to improve its accuracy.
